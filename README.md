# ðŸ¤– Robotic Arm with 5 DOF

This project showcases the design of a **5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) Robotic Arm**, built and simulated using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/). The arm includes five joints that allow for a wide range of motion, mimicking real-world robotic applications for learning, prototyping, and development purposes.

## ðŸ”§ Project Features

- âœ… 5 DOF: Base rotation, Shoulder, Elbow, Wrist, and Gripper
- âœ… Fully simulated using Tinkercad Circuits
- âœ… Controlled via Arduino Uno and servo motors
- âœ… Educational design, great for robotics beginners and students

## ðŸ›  Tools & Components

- Tinkercad Circuits
- Arduino Uno
- Servo Motors (x5)
- Jumper wires & Breadboard
- 5V Power Supply
